# PureDogPWA
The PureDogPWA is a mash up of <a href="https://purecss.io/" target="_blank">PureCSS</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website" target="_blank">Doggone Minimal Website</a>, and <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-simple-pwa-template-project-85ae4927d14e">A Simple PWA Template Project</a>.
<p>
The goal of PureDogPWA is to have a PWA website template that:
<ol>
<li><b>is esponsive</b>. This means it changes size and some functionality based on the device being used. That means it should work well on desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.</li>
<li><b>always looks good</b>. It should always be easily legible and not get all funky looking. Doesn't matter the device, OS, browser, etc.</li>
<li><b>is installable as a PWA</b>. A progressive web app (PWA), a true one, can be installed on your device. That means it adds a little icon to your device just like a regular app. Then, a PWA offers these benefits: (1) it opens like a regular app, looks and feels and acts like a regular app. But, (2) it's not stored on your device - it doesn't take up a bunch of your storage. Only the little icon is stored on your device. And (3) updates are automatic - no need to download from an app store. PWAs are good.</li>
</ol>

In other words, it should just work.

Note: the "install PWA" is currently not working. That needs fixing.
