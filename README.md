# PureDogPWA
The PureDogPWA is a mash up of <a href="https://purecss.io/" target="_blank">PureCSS</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/crrdlx/doggone-minimal-website" target="_blank">Doggone Minimal Website</a>, and <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/a-simple-pwa-template-project-85ae4927d14e">A Simple PWA Template Project</a>.
<p>
The goal is to have a PWA website that is responsive (changes size, functionality based on the device - desktop, tablet, or mobile phone) and always looks good. In other words, it just works.
