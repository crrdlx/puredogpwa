            <h1>PWA page</h1>
            <h2>An installable Progressive Web App (PWA) responsive website that looks good on desktop, tablet, or mobile.</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h1 id="pwa-stuff">This is the <span style="color:firebrick">SimplePWA </span>addition stuff.</h1>
        <p>
            A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a great thing. On something like your phone, it looks, feels, and acts like a regular phone app. However...
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Whereas an app downloaded onto your phone takes up a bunch of your phone's storage space, a PWA takes very little space.</li>
            <li>It looks, acts, and feels just like a regular app.</li>
            <li>Updates done to the app are instantaneous. There's no need to "update."</li>
            <li>You're free from a big corporation's app store and their rules and whims.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The PureDogPWA relies heavily on the <a href="https://simplepwa.com">SimplePWA.com</a> template. That site links to very helpful tools in setting up proper images for your PWA as well.
        </p> 
        <h2>Essentials of a PWA</h2>
        <p>
            It's possible to "Add to home screen" any website. But, all this does is add an <em>icon/image</em> to your device. The icon is just a <em>link</em> to the web page. Tapping the icon then opens the page in a new tab in your web browser. When you close the browser, it's gone. This is handy, but it's not exactly a PWA.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its essence, the main qualifier of a PWA is that it <em>can be installed</em> on your device. Then, it opens in its <em>own</em> screen, separate from your brower. When you close your browser, the PWA is <em>still there</em>, just like an app would be. Turning a website into a PWA requires the following things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML code, like any website.</li>
            <li>A line of code in the head that includes: link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json". Add it to each page in the head.</li>
            <li>A manifest. It's named "manifest.json" and you should customize it.</li>
            <li>A service worker. This is a javascript file named "sw.js" and doesn't need to be changed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Try it</h2>
        <p>
            Try to make a PWA. Either mash up this PureDogPWA or try SimplePWA.com linked above.
